# The Zakhar Project

## About

Zakhar is a robotics UX project. The main aim is to decrease the anxiety of users interacting with a robot.

**Assumed**: that the humans can interact the most effective and seamless with other living creatures

**Suggested**: to develop a robot's program structure in the way when basics of its logic are understandable from the robot's behavior. The behavior should mimic the animal one (as the human is an animal too).

Suggested to split the program into three parts:

- Conscious
- Unconscious
- Reflexes

**Conscious** represents simple intentions: move forward, sleep, run away, search something, etc.

**Unconscious** is responsible to solve how to realize those intentions: what to do for moving, how to behave if looking something etc.

**Reflexes** are small algorithms that can monopolize Unconscious from Conscious in some very explicit situations. E.g. panic and fear if something breaking, convulsions if robot stuck and can't move as the conscious tells.

## Structure

### Hardware

Zakhar consists of 4 devices:

- Brain Platform ([source](https://github.com/an-dr/zakhar_brain))
- Face Module ([source](https://github.com/an-dr/zakhar-face-module))
- Moving Platform ([source](https://github.com/an-dr/zakhar_platform))
- Sensor Platform ([source](https://github.com/an-dr/zakhar_sensors))

Each platform has it's own battery and can work standalone. It's structures are represented on pictures bellow.

## Milestones

There are two types of milestones, with and without demonstration. Demonstrations intended to show important to the project features followed by an article, milestones without demonstrations mainly focused on technical part of the project

1. âœ… [Reptile Demo](https://github.com/an-dr/zakhar/releases/tag/reptile_demo) - implementing of a simple reptile instinct
    - Article: [Robot with the Conscious: Imitating animal behavior for reducing userâ€™s anxiety](https://blog.agramakov.me/2020/05/29/robot-with-the-conscious/)
2. âœ… [Zakharos](https://github.com/an-dr/zakhar/releases/tag/zakharos) - moving the core to the [ROS](https://www.ros.org/)
3. ðŸŸ§ Emotions Demo - emotions and reflexes
4. â¬œ ZakhaR.Giskard (Note: R.Giskard is a robot from novels by I.Asimov which could control human's emotions) - Further development of using conditioned and unconditioned responses
5. â¬œ Animal Demo - showing the robot to users and collecting responses for making conclusions of this iteration
